## An app for reporters to record phone calls

This app was born out of necessity: when the pandemic struck in March of 2020, millions of people had to learn how to work remotely.

For reporters at The Canadian Press, this meant finding new ways to do their jobs -- part of which is recording interviews and filing audio clips to go with their stories.

In the Before Times, that usually involved a landline phone, a mixing board and a desktop computer; with none of that equipment at hand, reporters had to improvise.

This often resulted in poor-quality audio or, worse, lost recordings from using third-party apps.

As a supervisor in the Broadcast department, I felt an urgent need to address this issue.

I couldn't find an existing app or service that did the job, so I built my own.

Using Twilio's low/no-code "Studio" platform, I made a simple call-recording app that reporters could access from anywhere.
